# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/

A subarray is a **contiguous non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

## Solution

Instead of using double for loop directly, sliding window is a good choice.

As the right side of the window moving forward, the left side moves when the sum of all the value in the window is satisfied the condition. Just record the least length of window.

Need to notice a special senario: the sum of the nums is smaller than target. This time the min_length could be float('inf'), but the result should be 0.


```python
def minSubArrayLen(target, nums):
    sum_ = 0
    n = len(nums)
    l = 0
    length = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    for r in range(n):
        sum_ += nums[r]
        while sum_ >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, r-l+1)
            sum_ -= nums[l]
            l += 1
            
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```
