# Reverse Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

## Solution

A good action is to store the third node into 'tmp': (1)->(2)->(3)

Instead of thinking it as a third pointer. It does not have to move forward like 'p' and 'q'.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        p = None
        q = head
        while q:
            tmp = q.next
            q.next = p
            p = q
            q = tmp
        
        head = p
        return head

```
