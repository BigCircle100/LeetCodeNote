# Remove Linked List Elements

## solution

Just remove.

But a better solution is to use a dummy head.

Do not forget to set the correct Head. If the value of Head is the removed value, the node of Head is also changed.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy_head = ListNode(next = head)
        p = dummy_head
        q = head

        while q:
            if q.val == val:
                p.next = q.next
                q = q.next
            else:
                p = p.next
                q = q.next
        head = dummy_head.next
        return head
```
