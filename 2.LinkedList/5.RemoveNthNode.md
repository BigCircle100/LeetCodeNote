# Remove Nth Node From End of List

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

## Solution

When deleting, dummy head should be included. Do not ask why any more.

The fast pointer should be n+1 step faster than the slow one. When the fast reach the end, the slow point to one before which is supposed to be deleted.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        slow = fast = dummy
        for i in range(n+1):
            fast = fast.next
            
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
