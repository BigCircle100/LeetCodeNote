# Intersection of Two Linked Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

## Solution

Get each length first. Make pointer of longer one move forward 'dif' step, then compare and move both pointer.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        countA = countB = 0

        p = headA
        q = headB

        while p:
            countA += 1
            p = p.next

        while q:
            countB += 1
            q = q.next
        
        if countA < countB:
            headA, headB = headB, headA
            countA, countB = countB, countA
        
        dif = countA - countB

        p = headA
        q = headB
        for i in range(dif):
            p = p.next
        
        while p:
            if p == q:
                return p
            p = p.next
            q = q.next
        return None
