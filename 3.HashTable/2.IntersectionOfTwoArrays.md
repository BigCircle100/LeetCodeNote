# Intersection of Two Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/

## Solution

Array is only suitable for the senario with **limited range**, because you need to know how large to malloc (the length of the array). Without specifying the range, you should use "set" or "dict" ("map" in c++) instead. 

But sometimes you still need to use array, because calculating hash value is time consuming and takes up more space, especially with many elements.

Array solution is omitted here.

```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        table = {}
        for num in nums1:
            table[num] = table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        res = set()
        for num in nums2:
            if num in table:
                res.add(num)
        
        return res
```

The get function can replace the defaultdict method. When the 'key' is not in table.keys(), it will get 0, else get the value of 'key'.
