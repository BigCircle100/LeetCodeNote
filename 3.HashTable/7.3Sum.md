# 3Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

## Solution

It is a little difficult to achieve "no duplicate triplets".

Here using two pointers.

Sort the element first. For loop each element and manipulate the element on its right with left and right pointer. If the sum is positive, move right pointer one space to the left. If the sum is negative, move left pointer one space to the right. If the sum is zero, record this triplets and move forward the left and right pointer if the forward element is equal to the elements they are pointing. Doing this while loop with each for loop element until left pointer meet the right.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                break
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            l = i+1
            r = n-1
            while l < r:
                if nums[i]+nums[l]+nums[r] > 0:
                    r -= 1
                elif nums[i]+nums[l]+nums[r] < 0:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    res.append((nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]))
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l+1]:
                        l += 1
                    while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r-1]:
                        r -= 1
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
        return res
```
