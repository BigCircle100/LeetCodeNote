# 4Sum II

https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum-ii/

## Solution

Spliting four nums in two groups and record the sum for each groups. So the hash table is like "sum: count" for the first group. (Sum is the sum in one group and count is the times that sum has appeared.) The second group can just check whether the opposite of their sum is in the hash table and record the count.


```python
class Solution:
    def fourSumCount(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], nums3: List[int], nums4: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        rec = {}
        for n1 in nums1:
            for n2 in nums2:
                if n1+n2 in rec:
                    rec[n1+n2] = rec.get(n1+n2, 0) + 1
            
        for n3 in nums3:
            for n4 in nums4:
                if -(n3+n4) in rec:
                    res += rec[-(n3+n4)]
        return res
