# Valid Anagram

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solution

### 1. array as hashtable

Use the ASCII diff as hash value

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        record = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            record[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1
        for c in t:
            record[ord(c)-ord('a')] -= 1
        for c in record:
            if c != 0:
                return False
        return True
```

### 2. defaultdict

Give a type of the default value in the dictionary. The default value are: int->0, str->''...

So there will not be any fault when visiting undefined keys.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        record1 = collections.defaultdict(int)
        record2 = collections.defaultdict(int)

        for c in s:
            record1[c] += 1
        for c in t:
            record2[c] += 1
        return record1 == record2
            
```
