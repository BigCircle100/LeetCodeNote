# Happy Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/



A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:

        rec = set()
        while True:
            n = self.getSum(n)
            if n == 1:
                return True
            if n in rec:
                return False
            rec.add(n)

    def getSum(self,num):
            sum_ = 0
            while num != 0:
                sum_ += (num % 10) ** 2
                num //= 10
            return sum_
            
```
There are many way to get the sum. You can use divmod function in python, or use str to slice the number.
