# Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

## solution

Why using hash table? Or when should we use hash table?

- When we need to find whether an element has appeared before or whether an element is in a specific set.

The key should be the element of nums. The value is the index because we need to return this. And there is no order for the keys (unordered map for c++).  

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if target - n in seen:
                return [i, seen[target-n]]
            seen[n] = i
        
        return []
```
